# Fighting Robot
### Fighting robot is the first project in summer training with [Smart Methods Foundation](https://github.com/smart-methods)

**Fighting robot is divided into two parts:**
>  1. The arm of the robot. → [Robot_Arm](https://github.com/RanaMHM/Robot_Arm) repository<br>
>    The HTML interface has been done to define the values of the arm motors and link them to the database through PHP . <br>

>  2. The base of the robot. →  [Robot_Base](https://github.com/RanaMHM/Robot_Base) repository.<br>
>     The HTML interface has been made to point the robot base in four directions and show the value saved in the database in a separate PHP page .
